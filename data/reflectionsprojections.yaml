  description: >
    Reflections | Projections, founded in 1995, is a technology conference
    operated by students in ACM@UIUC. Striving to cater to our community of
    students, alumni, and professionals, we provide a forum to share and learn
    about current advancements in computer science and its applications. We have
    tech talks from across the industry and academia, workshops and
    puzzle-solving events for attendees, Mechmania (our annual artificial
    intelligence programming competition), and Diversity Ã— Tech (a day of events
    celebrating diversity in tech). The entire conference is completely free for
    anyone to attend, regardless of age, major, or affiliation with UIUC. This
    year, Reflections | Projections will occur September 16th - September 21st.
